    "comment" : "There are seven adhikaraṇasamathadhamma, “principles for the settling of legal issues”, which are the same for the nuns and the monks. These are not rules in the ordinary sense and as such fall outside of the classification into serious and light offenses. Instead, they set out the proper methods for dealing with legal issues. The detailed explanation for these is found in the Samathakkhandhaka. The legal issues to be settled through these principles fall into four categories: disputes, accusations, offenses, and proceedings. “Proceedings” includes monastic procedures such as ordination and the keeping of the observance day (uposatha).",

There are thirty such rules for the nuns, the same number as for the monks, although only eighteen are held in common. These rules, together with the remaining rules of the Monastic Code, are classed as light offenses, lahukāpatti. For light offenses there is usually no penalty apart from confession. For the nissaggiya pācittiyas, however, any item involved in the committing of an offense must be relinquished. Once the offense has been confessed, the item is, with a few exceptions, returned to the offender.",

There are eight such rules for the bhikkhunis, four of which are shared with the bhikkhus. Anyone who breaches any of these rules immediately loses their status as a fully ordained monastic. They are expelled from the Sangha and ineligible for re-ordination for the rest of their life. The pārājikas, together with the next category of rules, the saṅghādisesas, are collectively known as serious offenses, garukāpatti.

These eight rules for the bhikkhunīs are equivalent to a single rule for the bhikkhus (bhikkhu-pācittiya 39). In summary, they say that a bhikkhunī who asks for special food must acknowledge the offense. There are four such rules for the bhikkhus, none of which are shared with the bhikkhunīs. What distinguishes these bhikkhu rules from the pācittiyas is the manner of confession. For these rules the confession is done using a unique formula, with the second rule being the only one in the Monastic Code where all the bhikkhu offenders confess together as a group.",
